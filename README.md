# dice_game_web_application
This is my very first web application. it uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a dice game. Each time the user refreshes the page, a random number is
generated for each player. The player with the highest number wins the game.

To run, open the folder in VS Code (or whatever code editor), and then copy the "Dicee.html" full file path into Chrome.
